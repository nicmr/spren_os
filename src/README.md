# Spren_os

This is my attempt at creating my own os with rust.
My primary goal is learning more about both rust in a no_std context and os development.

For the earlier stages of this project I'll be following the tutorials at https://os.phil-opp.com/.

This document will be expanded upon once I start to branch from the tutorial.
